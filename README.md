Home Automation using ESP8266 / Alexa Skills &amp; IBM Bluemix platform

ESP8266 programmed to connect to a MQTT server (IBM Bluemix in this case). Use IBM Bluemix service to create a MQTTserver. You can use another or a local server but the functions would have to changed accordingly.

The IBM bluemix account used in the code has since been de-activated.

Basic nodered flow to read/send data to the MQTT server and to handle requests from a custom alexa skill - no info included for the Alexa Skill but should be easy enough to see from the NodeRed Flow
